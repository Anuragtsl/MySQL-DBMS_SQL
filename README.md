# MySQL-DMBS_SQL

In this project I have created a nested company's database for performing diffrent operations using SQL queries

Just clone the repository and run the SQL_Queries.sql file in MySql Workbench,

Or run the queries one by one in Mysql prompt.


# Tech and Language Used

I have used MySql Workbench : https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
